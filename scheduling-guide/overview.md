# Project Scheduling Overview

### 1.0 Introduction

What defines a successful project? On time and under budget, right? But are these mutually exclusive? Can a project be late and under budget? Can a project be completed early and still be over budget? The answer to both of these questions is, of course, yes. There is an obvious connection here. Time is money. Depending on the contract type, you may be able to save on general condition costs and earn an early completion bonus by completing a project ahead of schedule.

A realistic and well-planned schedule is a key determinant of a successful construction project’s success and defines its attributes. This schedule should be developed at the project’s outset and used as a tool to manage the project through to its completion. By working with the project manager, engineer, superintendent and other stakeholder responsible for timely project delivery, a scheduler, or one designated as the scheduler, can develop a project schedule that can be updated on a monthly basis to accurately reflect project status and potential delays as well as impacts caused by changes to the contract.

A successful project involves teamwork. Each member of the management team must buy into the schedule with one objective: a timely (and therefore successful) project. This could mean the owner, general contractor, and subcontractors all make money without overworking the staff (imagine that!).

#### The Purpose of this Guide

Construction scheduling is inherently complex and unique to each project, making a universal “one-size-fits-all” approach impossible. Effective scheduling provides a comprehensive understanding of the project, identifies plan details that require clarification, and establishes clear objectives. While scheduling can range from simple Gantt charts to complex Critical Path Method (CPM) schedules, thorough planning is crucial. The more you analyze and plan, the more dynamic and successful your project will likely become. Embrace detailed scheduling as a critical tool for project management.

### 1.1 The Baseline Schedule

Before starting any construction project, it’s essential to have a plan, or roadmap, in place. This plan, known as the baseline schedule, must be well thought out and indicative of the approach we propose for building the project. Developing this schedule can be challenging during the critical start-up phase of the project, but it is essential to allocate sufficient time, as the schedule’s accuracy and thoroughness are crucial to creating an effective management tool.

The baseline schedule is a management tool that helps us achieve our goals and fulfill our commitments to our clients.

It is essential that the schedule includes the entire scope of work. It should also take into account the necessary resources required to construct the project. Consideration should be given to manpower, trade coordination, crew numbers and sizes, man-hours, safety, and other factors that may affect the work plan. It should include accurate logic and durations required to construct the job. At a minimum, the following should be considered in the baseline:

* The entire contract scope of work should be incorporated
* Durations should be based on productivity rates consistent with the region
* All logic sequences should be based on industry-accepted standards
* All contractual milestones, including completion dates, should be included
* Activities shall not include multiple trades such as “MEP Rough-in” or “Exterior Skin”.
* Activities should account for submittals and resubmittals, as well as review and acceptance
* All long lead items should be accounted for
* Include the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) consistent with national scheduling department requirements
* Include designer, subcontractors, vendors, and in some cases, Client activities necessary for us to perform our work (we must integrate all schedules into our baseline schedule)
* Account for work restrictions such as holidays, Client’s holidays, and moratoriums
* Contain and include reasonable float per activity as well as total float
* Contain an accurate and valid Critical Path

### 1.2 Schedule Data

Initially, the development of the baseline schedule should be a joint effort between preconstruction and operations. It should demonstrate a workable strategy for achieving the contract end date, but also demonstrate how contract milestones and your company’s internal milestones will be met. It should also demonstrate cooperation among the major groups responsible for winning projects. One common goal for everyone!

The development of the baseline schedule should include input from all major subcontractors, vendors, and designers whose work is critical or near-critical to the project baseline. It should include realistic durations provided by our subcontractors, vendors, and designers for the performance of their respective work. The reliability of these schedules must be verified before integrating them into the baseline schedule.

Once approved, the baseline schedule should be understood by everyone assigned to the project and used not only to manage our work but also to manage the work of our subcontractors, vendors, and designers (in design-build pursuits).

<Tip>
The schedule must be in full compliance with the contract documents and in the best interest of your company. There should only be one baseline schedule on the job, and it should not be modified without prior written approval from the owner.
</Tip>


### 1.3 Schedule Updates

Without a solid baseline schedule, we will be unable to measure the project’s performance accurately. Not only should the baseline be updated to track progress and performance, ensuring the timely completion of work, but it will also be used to measure delays and impacts on the performance of our work. Just as important as developing a strong and effective baseline schedule, updating the schedule is a vital part of project management. Think of it as creating a new baseline each time you update the schedule. You have a new job start date (data date), new remaining activities (remaining durations), and new logic (minor revisions and change orders) each time you update.

Things happen; subcontractors may perform better or worse than expected, it may rain a lot, owners make changes, and approvals may be late. A construction project is continually changing. Due to the dynamic nature of construction, the schedule must be continually reviewed and updated, often on a daily basis.

The schedule updates reflect the current plan and should always be compared to the baseline schedule in order to quantify how many days ahead or behind the project is, also referred to as positive or negative variance.

### 1.4 A Good Starting Point: Interactive Planning Sessions

As you embark on your baseline schedule journey, a good starting point is an interactive planning session. Interactive planning can prove invaluable in building your baseline schedule. It promotes agreement by all participants and brings stakeholders together as the baseline schedule is developed.

<Note>
### Best Practice

The recommended best practice is to conduct an interactive planning session before the schedule is entered into Primavera.
</Note>

To be truly interactive, the right group of decision makers must be brought together in a room before the baseline schedule is finalized. The group then creates an oversized project timeline. This enables everyone to view critical information simultaneously, facilitating important scheduling discussions.

### 1.5 Zooming Out: The Schedule Narrative

Now that you have populated your baseline schedule with the details and know how to navigate the project roadmap, it is time to return to the “aerial view” once again. While creating a graphic representation of the project schedule using CPM is at the heart of scheduling, it is also essential that you create a schedule narrative. This schedule narrative provides stakeholders unfamiliar with CPM a clear understanding of all the important details captured in the baseline schedule.

Although the content of your narrative will vary, it should at a minimum cover the following items:

1. [The executive summary](project-scheduling-overview.md#the-executive-summary)
2. [The critical path](project-scheduling-overview.md#the-critical-path)
3. [The secondary critical path](project-scheduling-overview.md#the-secondary-critical-path)
4. [Status this month](project-scheduling-overview.md#status-this-month)
5. [Items affecting progress](project-scheduling-overview.md#items-affecting-progress)
6. [Near-Term Schedule](project-scheduling-overview.md#near-term-schedul)
7. [Other issues this month](project-scheduling-overview.md#other-issues-this-month)
8. [Schedule revisions](project-scheduling-overview.md#schedule-revisions)
9. [Attachments](project-scheduling-overview.md#attachments).

#### **The Executive Summary**

In this introductory paragraph, create an aerial view of your project for the reader. It should summarize all the information that will be detailed in the subsequent sections and provide a concise overview of the project status.

#### **The Critical Path**

Describe the current critical path. The critical path may change throughout the project's duration as items shift in the schedule, so this is your opportunity to inform readers of the current critical path. Also, provide details about how the critical path has changed since the last update.

#### **The Secondary Critical Path**

In this section, describe the second most critical path. This section provides team members with advanced notice of potential scheduling pinch points.

#### **Status This Month**

Describe in detail which activities were started, which were completed, and which are still in progress. Discuss items that progressed more quickly than anticipated, and vice versa. This is also an opportunity to identify and describe items that are not currently on the critical path, but could become critical path items if not addressed.

#### **Items Affecting Progress**

Conduct a jobsite walk with the superintendent and identify any potential scheduling issues that need to be addressed. Solutions should be identified and described in this section.

#### **Near-Term Schedule**

Describe the activities slated to occur over the next 6-12 weeks in detail. Include any critical path items as well as procurement activities. Group this section by responsibility. When creating a six-week look-ahead, a good way to gauge what to include is to think of the look-ahead as a tool for communicating with subcontractors regarding manpower, material procurement, and other relevant details.

#### **Other Issues This Month**

Describe any contract changes that may affect the critical path. In addition, outline change order issues, PCOs, missing submittals, inclement weather, unforeseen conditions, RFIs, etc. This section is important, so be thorough.

#### **Schedule Revisions**

In this section, carefully describe any critical changes that were made that affected the schedule. Do not include minor project changes, such as revisions to interior finish selection that have no impact on the schedule. This section should focus on items that affect, or could affect, the critical path.

#### **Attachments**

This section provides an opportunity to include additional items that support the narrative. Items may include several or all of the following:

1. Updated schedule bar chart
2. Updated three-week look-ahead
3. Updated milestone report
4. Photos
5. Relative PCOs
6. Update submittals register.

#### Who Should Participate?

Every interactive planning session must include anyone whose work will directly impact on-time delivery.

Attendee checklist for the interactive planning session:

* [x] Project executive
* [x] Project managers
* [x] Project planner/scheduler
* [x] Design manager
* [x] Construction manager
* [x] Design discipline leads
* [x] End user
* [x] Commissioning agent
* [x] Other project-specific stakeholders

#### Supplies needed:

* [x] A large room with sufficient walls and seating space
* [x] A large, time-scaled chart (plotter paper across a wall, marked off by month and allowing more space at the beginning and less later on)
* [x] 4”x4” squares of colored paper (color coded by discipline/organization/category) to post on the chart
* [x] Markers
* [x] Tape
* [x] A digital camera to photograph the finished product

#### Step-by-Step Process

1. Set aside sufficient time based on the project size.
   * The minimum time required is typically half a day.
   * Larger projects can require a full day or several days.
2. Prepare the room ahead of time.
   * If the project is large, choose a room with plenty of wall space.
   * Reserve the room according to the anticipated duration.
3. Write activities on post-it notes and position them under the corresponding date.
4. Adjust the post-it notes in accordance with the discussion.
   * Use forward passes and backward passes to determine the start and finish dates.
   * As start and finish dates are posted, reach an agreement on what is needed and achievable.
5. Once agreement is reached, photograph the finished product and use it to build the baseline schedule.

#### Order for Posting Activities:

1. Project milestones that establish the parameters for the project schedule:
   * Project start
   * Funding
   * Substantial completion
   * Mechanical completion
   * Commissioning time
   * Occupancy date.
2. Red flag items (use red paper):
   * Fixed dates
   * Critical items
   * Trouble spots.
3. Design releases and deliverables, by package/discipline:
   * Schematic/preliminary design dates
   * Detailed design dates.
4. Key construction dates, such as:
   * Need IFB docs
   * Need IFC docs
   * Begin foundations
   * Begin structural steel
   * Begin elevated slabs
   * Begin OH rough-ins
   * Begin interiors.
5. Identify the sequencing of work areas, enabling works, and utility tie-ins.
6. Add trigger points and need dates for specific items such as:
   * Floor plans approved
   * P\&IDs issued
   * GMP signed.
7. Need dates for equipment deliveries, anticipated fabrication, and delivery time to verify the need dates for design and specifications versus availability.
8. Build a subcontracting strategy for key early and critical packages.
9. Add other items as necessary to capture the whole picture.
