The graphic below breaks CPM into five “simple” steps. In truth, each step is associated with the definitions and calculations and project-specific twists and turns introduced in section 1.1, but breaking CPM down chronologically is a great way to get a grasp on scheduling your project.

## 1. Establish Goals

If you want to arrive at your destination on time, you need to know where you are going.

#### **Process for establishing goals:**

1. Gather all project data needed for schedule development
2. Read the contract
3. Identify project-specific goals
4. Coordinate scheduling goals with management.

#### **Project goals may include one or all of the following:**

* Keeping the project on track
* Illustrating how and when the owner’s overall goals will be met
* Developing phasing to work on an existing campus or within an owner’s budget constraints
* Communicating project progress with stakeholders
* Coordinating construction sequences
* Identifying early procurement items
* Establishing critical path activities
* Insert _your_ project-specific concern here.

## 2. Identify Activities

Break down the goals you have established into manageable work activities to determine which tasks need to be scheduled.

#### **Process for developing activity lists:**

1. Study the contract drawings and specifications
2. Categorize activities according to responsibility, phase and location
3. Categorize major work by systems, e.g. drywall partitions, mechanical systems, elevators, etc.
4. Break schedule into major segments including general conditions, material procurement, foundations, structure, exterior, rough-ins, finishes, close-out
5. Break out activities into workable units, e.g. framing, first floor; framing, second floor
6. Identify typical “subsets,” then enter this information into a scheduling program
7. Identify duplicate activities such as typical floors or assemblies
8. Talk to your subcontractors for activity details— they are truly experts in their fields

<Warning>
Concentrate on critical activities and trades at first. You can add more detail as you continue to study the specifications and drawings and talk to subcontractors, consultants and colleagues. It isn’t possible to cover everything the first go-around, so don’t get overwhelmed.
</Warning>

#### **Ask yourself: What is the appropriate level of detail for activities?**

As you generate activity lists, one challenge is determining the “level of detail.” For starters, activities should be _quantifiable and measurable_. In addition, pay attention to the following guidelines:

* Break down activities by subcontractor—“build toilet rooms,” for example, is too vague and encompasses several trades
* As detail is added, code the activities so you can “roll up” to easier-to-read summary bars or hammocks
* Establish consistent detail throughout—if sprinklers are shown by floor, then ductwork, electrical, etc. should also be shown by floor
* Make sure the level of detail for critical-path activities will allow contract changes to tie into the critical path
* Associate milestones with the start or end of groups of activities.
* Make sure you can identify who (subcontractor), what (quantities) and where (location).

## 3. Estimate Durations

Now that you have developed your activity list, it is time to determine how long each activity will take.

#### **Process for developing activity durations:**

1. Select unit of measure (i.e. days, weeks or months)
2. Consider seasonal conditions
3. Identify work restrictions, including local customs, labor agreements, etc.
4. Perform quantity take-offs as needed
5. Use productivity analysis: units per time period, number of crews, manpower
6. Establish production rates, e.g. LF of drywall/day (see Production Rates, section 1.3)

<Warning>
When assigning durations, stay realistic. Overly ambitious activity durations early in the project can mean you spend the rest of the project playing catch-up. Take site logistics, weather impacts and the labor market into account from the start. &#x20;
</Warning>

### The Duration Calculation Formula

To calculate durations for each of your activities, use the duration calculation formula, below.


#### Q = Quantity

Perform a take-off or refer to the estimate to determine the quantity of each material associated with the items on your activity list. For instance:

> Carpet tile = 600 square yards

#### P = Productivity

Find the productivity rate associated with each activity, using Means, Walker, historic data or other resources. For instance, per the productivity rates starting on page 44:

> Normal productivity rate for one crew, installing carpet tile = 100 SY/day

#### N = Number of workers or crew

Determine your crew size or the number of crews required for each activity. As part of this step, be sure to consider the logistics and area available to perform the work, and the duration of other activities. Contact subcontractors for input as required. For instance, assume that:

> The subcontractor can provide two crews, which the project site will also accommodate = two (2) crews

Keep in mind that in some cases the production rate reflects production per worker, while in others it reflects production per crew.

#### How it works:

Using the numbers from our example:

> 3 days = 600SY/(100SY/day)(2)

### Additional Considerations

#### **Crew sizes:**

* Convert quantities to man-days, using RS Means, Walker, your historical database, or subcontractor input.
* Once you calculate the man-days, then you can determine the crew size or the number of workers needed.
* Can one crew handle the work? If so, does this align with the other trade crews? If the drywall studs are installed by two crews, for instance, you aren’t ahead of the game if the finish trades can only provide one crew.

#### **Overtime:**

* Studies have shown that productivity dwindles when crews work overtime
* Use additional shifts, crews or workers in lieu of overtime, when possible
* Only use overtime for “short schedule gains.”

***

### Learning Curves

When using typical production rate data, do not expect subcontractors to meet that productivity number on the first day. Learning curves vary from trade to trade, and if the subcontractors are required to stop and start work in the field, you may need to take multiple learning curves into account.

## 4. Determine Sequences

With your activities and durations in hand, it is now time to determine the relationships between activities.

#### **Process for developing activity logic:**

1. Determine when each activity needs to happen relative to other activities
2. Take primary contract relationships into consideration
3. Determine which work must be completed before other activities can begin
4. Determine what work cannot start until other work is complete
5. Determine relationship types (as defined in this section)
6. Use “finish-to-start” relationships whenever possible

<Warning>
Use lags sparingly (a lag is a specified delay between the start or completion of one activity and the start or completion of another activity).
</Warning>

### What are relationship types?

In CPM scheduling, relationship types are used to establish the proper sequencing of activities. There are three relationship types that dictate how a project can be sequenced. The activity relationship types are:

* **Finish to Start (FS)**
* **Start to Start (SS)**
* **Finish to Finish (FF)**

You should start the process of determining a relationship type by asking if the activities meet the FS relationship (described on below). If they do not, then either the SS or the FF relationship will apply. Using this process is the best way to determine your critical paths.

While it is sometimes necessary to introduce lag, there should be a good reason to do so, as described further on.

#### Finish to Start (FS) Relationship

The finish-to-start relationship occurs when “activity B cannot begin until activity A has been 100 percent completed.” If this is true, this rule tests “positive” and should be used as the relationship type.

If, on the other hand, this relationship does not test positive, the relationship should not be used.

<Frame caption="FS example: Metal studs, level 2, cannot begin until CMU, level 2, is 100 percent completed.">
<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png" alt="" />
</Frame>

#### Start to Start (SS) Relationship

The start-to-start relationship occurs when “activity B cannot begin until activity A has at least started.” If this is true, then the rule tests “positive” and should be used as the relationship.

If this relationship tests “negative,” then the SS relationship should not be used.

<Frame caption="SS example: Taping and finishing cannot begin until installing the gypsum board has begun">
<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png" alt="" />
</Frame>

#### Finish to Finish (FF) Relationship

The finish-to-finish relationship occurs when “activity B cannot be 100 percent completed until activity A is 100 percent completed.” If this is true, then the rule tests “positive” and the relationship should be used.

If this relationship tests negative, it should not be used.

<Frame caption="FF example: The ceiling tile cannot be 100 percent completed until the ceiling grid is 100 percent installed.">
<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png" alt="" />
</Frame>

<Warning>
In general, use F-S relationships as much as possible to develop your baseline schedule. By doing this, you will more than likely exceed the contract duration initially, but it is easier to go back and overlap activities than to overlap activities arbitrarily to begin with.
</Warning>

#### Lag

Each of the three relationship constraints includes a scenario that incorporates lag. While lags are often inevitable, they should not be overused.

Lag is expressed numerically, in either workdays or calendar days. Lag represents the number of days anticipated to pass before the next activity can start or finish. The planner/scheduler must exercise discretion to determine how crew, resource or material restraints may dictate using lag strategically.

<Warning>
The planner/scheduler should use lag only after a detailed analysis by the team has determined that each tie is truly representative of how crew and material resources will affect the workflow. The project superintendent must then take responsibility for running the job according to the schedule. Failure to do so may result in withheld progress payments and, in extreme cases, the termination of the contract for failure to comply with the contract terms.
</Warning>

Therefore, communication during this phase is critical.

## 5. Analyze and Adjust

Before you finalize and publish the schedule, it is critical that you evaluate the initial schedule and make improvements where possible.

#### **Process for analyzing and adjusting:**

1. Strategically compress the schedule if necessary
2. Strategically expand the schedule if necessary
3. Confirm the project duration is acceptable
4. Check to make sure the critical path is logical
5. Confirm that all pertinent work activities (and trades) are included
6. Make sure all activities are properly linked
7. Confirm that the contract requirements are met.

### Schedule Compression

If your initial schedule exceeds the contract date, ask yourself if the durations are too long. Are they justifiable? You should also review all of the F-S relationships on the path. Determine solutions for revising F-S relationships to S-S or F-F with a lag until you are able to adequately compress the schedule.

### Schedule Expansion

If your initial schedule is too short, ask yourself if the durations are too short. Are they justifiable? You should also review all the relationships along the critical path. Ask yourself whether you should strategically change SS or FF relationships to FS.

## 6. Communicate

You are ready to review and publish the schedule.

#### Process for communicating and publishing the schedule:

1. Review the schedule with the appropriate internal staff
2. Review the schedule with the appropriate external parties
3. Consider relevant input and feedback in the revision
4. Publish and distribute the schedule to appropriate parties.

<Warning>
## Publishing quick-tips:

- A schedule does no good if it merely hangs on the wall
- The schedule should be updated daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on the project size and complexity
- Print your schedule in a format that can be easily understood by the targeted audience
- The higher the level of management reviewing the schedule, the more simplified and summarized your schedule should be.
</Warning>

### Internal Customer List and Corresponding Schedule Focus:

* **Management** – staff planning, cash flow, work-in-place, business unit earnings
* **Purchasing** – lead times, bid schedule, purchasing times, internal resource coordination
* **Engineering** – schedule submittals, permits, approvals, delivery lead times, required-on-job (ROJ) dates
* **Accounting** – cash flow
* **Cost department** – WIP, business unit earnings, historical information, indicated outcome report (IOR)
* **Estimating** – establish overhead costs, temporary facilities, weather-related costs.

### External Customer List and Corresponding Schedule Focus:

* **Owners** – cash flow (revenue and payables), owner- furnished equipment scheduling, move-in and commissioning coordination
* **Architects/Engineers** – submittal reviews, construction administration staffing, punch list
* **Legal services** – claims
* **City officials** – schedule inspections, fees
* **Bond companies** – determine future bonding capacity for the contractor and subcontractors
