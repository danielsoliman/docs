A good CPM schedule is the foundation of a successful construction project. Proper CPM scheduling increases the likelihood of success for contractors and owners and decreases the potential for financial losses associated with delays. It is a management tool that evaluates progress and analyzes the impact of day-to-day operations on the overall construction project.

Unfortunately, not all CPM schedules bring such value to the project. You must spend the appropriate amount of time and effort on its development to ensure you have a tool for your project’s success.

Therefore, a CPM schedule is more than just a schedule. A good CPM allows the project manager to build the project on the computer before building it in the field.

#### A good CPM schedule shows the:

* interrelationship of all activities;
* logical sequence of construction;
* emphasis of on-site and off-site activities, and;
* relationship of each activity to the overall project completion.

<Warning>
Anyone in construction project management will be better equipped to take on the challenges and complexities of managing the construction project if they are prepared.

There is no better way of being prepared than to develop a fully detailed CPM.
