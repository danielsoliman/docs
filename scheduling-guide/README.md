# Why a scheduling guide?

## Construction lack's standards

Construction is one of the few industries where standards make things more inefficient, which is why they generally don't exist unless required by law. One of the reasons is clients may have their own requirements which directly contradict any standard a contractor has attempted to implement.

### Community of Practice

While we lack standard's we're still able to work as a team and get things done.&#x20;


Construction teams aren't an orchestra, they're a jazz band. If the plumber doesn't show up for a week, we'll still riff and finish on time.


A community of practice in place of standards means there's not much documentation, and you "just have to know" what you're doing, by doing it with someone who's been doing it longer.

Since the scheduling community within the construction industry is small, this is even more extreme.&#x20;

### Nobody can just teach themselves scheduling

Sure, there are some youtube videos, but you need real world experience to really _learn_ how to schedule.&#x20;

With all that, its obvious most schedulers started off by faking it at first.

## Who this guide for

This guide is for all construction professionals whether they've been scheduling for 20+ years or are interested in getting started.

## Who this guide is not for

If you don't have at least 2-years construction experience, then you need to get that first. It's impossible to be an effective planner team leader if you don't understand the scope or even know industry terms.
