## 1. Activity Naming Schema

1. Avoid words like “Install” or “Place” unless its in the context of other work being removed
   1. Install is the default in construction. “Light Fixtures” as an activity name is good enough.
2. Avoid redundant vocabulary
   1. Rough In Plumbing Gravity Storm, In-Wall - Storm is enough to know its Plumbing and its Gravity
   2. Level 1 Area 1 - Rough In Mechanical Duct OH should just be Rough In OH Duct
3. AVOID ALL CAPS
4.
   1. Harder to read
   2. Takes up more space
   3. Looks less professional
   4. Pro tip: Use a small caps font
5. Avoid Notes or Comments
6. Rename activities only to clarify what they represent, the intent should be unchanched
7. Deleted Activities should be moved to another project so they can be recovered if necessary

## 2. Work Breakdown Structure

\
The work should be broken down by Phase and by Area. Phasing here has two meanings and both apply.

### A. What to include

#### a. Phasing by permit

The phasing in this sense is usually indicated in the design and includes demolition work. Sometimes phases can have

#### b. Phasing or sequence

The phasing in this sense refers to the Phase of work. An example includes:

1. Site
2. Substructure
3. Superstructure
4. Envelope
5.
   1. Skin
   2. Roof
6. Interior Buildout
7.
   1. Systems
   2. Finishes
8. Systems (MEPF)

#### c. Area (Sequence)

Areas are usually dictated by the Project Superintendent. These areas are usually broken up into “bite-size” chunks where work can more easily be managedCIP structures usually are broken up into 10,000 SF poursSkin is usually broken up by Elevation (N,W,S,E) and by finish type (metal panel, precast, glazing, etc.)Interior are usually broken up by building area around 50,000sf chunks. We typically use the Fire-Rated Walls as bounds for these areas. If possible, use the MEP zones.

#### d. Chunks of work (by time)

Ideally WBS should not have big gaps of time where a handful of activities take place

### B. How to name and Code WBS

#### a. Codes

* Keep codes super concise, no more than 5 characters
* avoid . and /, these are “separators” and wreak havoc when importing to other programs
* Keep in mind that

#### b. Names

* Also keep concise, use whole words, no more than 3 or 4
* no need to carry over words from parent WBS (with the exception of bottom-most WBS, see below 👇)
* Do not include quantities or takeoffs (i.e. SF)

#### C. Pro Tips

* If a WBS has children WBS, it shouldn’t also have Tasks
* The bottom line WBS should stand on its own
*
  * i.e. Level 3 Area A - along with the task name, this should be enough for anyone to know exactly where and what on the project
  * Precast West L1-3 - again, its obvious this is building exterior

### What not to include in your WBS

1. Do not break up work by trade.
2. Do not break up work by person or entity in charge
3. Do not go backwards
4.
   1. for example, once you’ve broken up by Area, don’t further breakdown by phasing or sequence.
5. Do not go

## 3. KISS - Keep it simple, Stupid

### Rule# 1: Remember your audience.

The schedule is for the superintendent to use to manage his project. It is not to prove how savy you are with P6, or to justify your hours. If your scheduler takes less than 60 seconds to review the schedule, you’ve lost him. Start over.

1. As a general rule of thumb, there should be no more than 1,000 activities for every $100M in construction volume
2. There should be no more than 100 WBS under any circumstance
3. Keep text concise as possible.
4. Aim for at least 1 WBS on each page
5. If you’ve got more activities taking place in one day then there are workers on site, you’re doing it wrong
6. No need to track procurement and submittals, we’ve got Procore, LeadTime, and other flows that connect these things to the schedule.
