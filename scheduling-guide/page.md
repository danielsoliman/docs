### Section 1

#### Project Scheduling Overview

**1.0 Introduction**

What defines a successful project? On time and under budget, right? But are these mutually exclusive? Can a project be late and under budget? Can a project be early and over budget? The answer to both of these questions is, of course, yes. There is an obvious connection here. Time is money. Depending on the contract type, you could save in general condition costs, earn an early completion bonus, etc. all by completing a project early.

A realistic and well-planned schedule defines the attributes of a successful construction project, and is a key determinant of the project’s success. This schedule should be developed at the start of the project and used as a tool to manage the project through its completion. By working with the project manager, engineer, superintendent and other stakeholders responsible for timely project delivery, a scheduler, or one designated as the scheduler, can develop a project schedule that can be updated on a monthly basis to accurately reflect project status and potential delays as well as impacts caused by changes to the contract.

A successful project involves teamwork. Each member of the management team has to buy into the schedule with one objective…a timely (and therefore successful) project. This could mean the owner, general contractor and subcontractors all make money without overworking the staff (imagine that!).

**The Purpose of this Book**

Let’s start this manual out by saying there is nothing typical about construction. Construction practices and productivity vary from project to project, job to job, region to region. So the idea of developing a scheduling process that is a “one-size-fits-all”, is easy and not time consuming is simply impossible. It can’t be done.

But what can be done is to simplify the process. There are a couple of aspects to consider. First, if one understood construction, for example hard construction logic, durations, acceptable practices, that person need only learn how to schedule. On the other hand, if one understood how to schedule, including the latest scheduling software and techniques, then that person need only learn about construction practices. Believe it or not, there are some who understand both - these individuals usually go far in their profession. And there are some who really don’t understand either as completely as they should, but somehow get by.

Proper scheduling of a construction project assures an understanding of the entire scope of the project and may, during the schedule development process, identify areas of the plans and specifications of the project that require greater detail and understanding. It’s important to understand the project. As such, construction scheduling helps to establish project objectives and then provides a plan for achieving these objectives.

Construction scheduling could take the form of a simple Gantt bar chart or a more involved CPM schedule depending on the project requirements. A true CPM is not always required for all construction projects. But bear in mind, you cannot over-think or over-analyze a project.

The more you think, plan and analyze, the better your plan, the more dynamic and effective your work product and the more successful your project is likely to be. So make a habit of using CPM – your project will benefit.

**1.1 The Baseline Schedule**

Before starting any construction project it’s important that we have a plan, or roadmap, in place. This plan, called the baseline schedule, must be well thought-out and indicative of the way we propose building the project. Developing this schedule is often difficult during the critical start-up phase of the project, but appropriate time must be allotted since the schedule’s accuracy and thoroughness is essential to creating an effective management tool.

The baseline schedule is a management tool that assists us in achieving our goals and commitments to our clients. It is essential that the schedule includes the entire scope of work. It should also take into account the necessary resources required to construct the project. Consideration should be given to manpower, trade coordination, crew numbers and sizes, man-hours, safety and other factors that may affect the work plan. It should include accurate logic and durations required to construct the job. At a minimum, the following should be considered in the baseline:

* The entire contract scope of work should be incorporated
* Durations should be based on productivity rates consistent with the region
* All logic sequences should be based on industry accepted standards
* All contractual milestones including completion dates should be included
* Activities shall not include multiple trades such as “MEP Rough-in” or “Exterior Skin”.
* Activities should account for submittals and resubmittals, as well as review and acceptance
* All long lead items should be accounted for
* Include the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) consistent with national scheduling department requirements
* Include designer, subcontractors, vendors and in some cases Client activities necessary for us to perform our work (we must integrate all schedules into our baseline schedule)
* Account for work restrictions such as holidays, Client’s holidays and moratoriums
* Contain and include reasonable float per activity as well as total float
* Contain an accurate and valid Critical Path (contiguous path)

**1.2 Schedule Data**

Initially the development of the baseline schedule should be a joint effort between preconstruction and operations. It should demonstrate a workable strategy for achieving the contract end date but also demonstrate how contract milestones and your company’s internal milestones will be met. It should also demonstrate cooperation within the major groups charged with winning projects. One common goal between everyone!

The development of the baseline schedule should include input from all major subcontractors, vendors, and designers whose work is critical or near critical to the project baseline. It should include realistic durations provided by our subcontractors, vendors, and designers for the performance of their respective work. The reliability of these schedules are required to be verified before integrating into the baseline schedule.

Once approved, the baseline schedule should be understood by everyone assigned to that project, and used not only to manage our work but also to manage the work of our subcontractors, vendors, and designers (in design/build pursuits). The schedule must be in full compliance with the contract documents and in your company’s best interest. There should only be one baseline schedule on the job and it should not be modified without prior written approval from the owner.

**1.3 Schedule Updates**

Without a good baseline schedule we will not be able to measure performance on the project. Not only should the baseline be updated to track progress and performance to ensure timely completion of work but it will also be used to measure delays and impacts to the performance of our work. Just as important as developing a strong and effective baseline schedule, the schedule update must be a vital part of project management. Think of it as creating a new baseline each time you update the schedule. You have a new job start date (data date) and new remaining activities (remaining durations) and new logic (minor revisions and change orders) each time you update.

Things happen; subcontractors may perform better or worse than expected, it may rain a lot, owners make changes; approvals may be late. A construction project is continually changing. Because of the dynamic nature of construction, the schedule must be continually reviewed and updated, sometimes on a daily basis.

The schedule updates reflect the current plan and should always be compared to the baseline schedule in order to quantify how many days ahead or behind the project is, also referred to as positive or negative variance.

**1.4 A Good Starting Point: Interactive Planning Sessions**

As you embark on your baseline schedule journey, a good starting point is an interactive planning session. Interactive planning can prove invaluable in building your baseline schedule. It promotes agreement by all participants and brings stakeholders together as the baseline schedule is developed.

**Best practice**: The recommended best practice is to conduct an interactive planning session before the schedule is entered into Primavera.

**QR**: To be truly interactive, the right group of decision makers must be brought together in a room before the baseline schedule is finalized. The group then creates an oversized project timeline. This allows everyone’s critical information to be viewed simultaneously while allowing important scheduling discussions to occur.

**1.5 Zooming Out: The Schedule Narrative**

Now that you have populated your baseline schedule with the details and know how to navigate the project roadmap, it is time to return to the “aerial view” once again. While creating a graphic representation of the project schedule using CPM is at the heart of scheduling, it is also essential that you create a schedule narrative. This schedule narrative offers stakeholders unfamiliar with CPM a way to understand all of the important details you have captured in the baseline schedule.

Although the content of your narrative will vary, it should at a minimum cover the following items:

1. The executive summary
2. The critical path
3. The secondary critical path
4. Status this month
5. Items affecting progress
6. Six-week look-ahead
7. Other issues this month
8. Schedule revisions
9. Attachments.

**The Executive Summary**: In this introductory paragraph, create an aerial view of your project for the reader. It should summarize all of the information that will be detailed in the subsequent sections and indicate the project status in summary fashion.

**The Critical Path**: Describe the current critical path. The critical path may change throughout the duration of the project as items shift in the schedule, so this is your opportunity to let readers know the current critical path. Also, provide details about how the critical path has changed since the last update.

**The Secondary Critical Path**: In this section, describe the second most critical path. This section is an opportunity to provide team members with a heads-up regarding possible pinch points in the schedule.

**Status This Month**: Describe in detail which activities were started, which were completed, and which are still in progress. Discuss items that progressed more quickly than anticipated, and vice versa. This is also an opportunity to identify and describe items that are not on the critical path currently, but that could become critical path items if not addressed.

**Items Affecting Progress**: Conduct a jobsite walk with the superintendent and identify any potential scheduling issues that need to be addressed. Solutions should be identified and described in this section.

**Six-Week Look-Ahead**: Describe the activities slated to occur over the next six weeks, in detail. Include any critical path items as well as procurement activities. Group this section by responsibility. When creating a six-week look-ahead, a good way to gauge what to include is to think of the look-ahead as a tool for communicating with subcontractors regarding manpower, material procurement, etc.

**Other Issues This Month**: Describe any contract changes that may affect the critical path. In addition, outline change order issues, PCOs, missing submittals, inclement weather, unforeseen conditions, RFIs, etc. This section is important, so be thorough.

**Schedule Revisions**: In this section, carefully describe any critical changes that were made that affected the schedule. Do not include minor project changes, such as interior finish selection revisions, that had no effect on the schedule. This section should focus on items that affect, or could affect, the critical path.

**Attachments**: This section provides an opportunity to include additional items that support the narrative. Items may include several or all of the following:

1. Updated schedule bar chart
2. Updated three-week look-ahead
3. Updated milestone report
4. Photos
5. Relative PCOs
6. Update submittals register.

**Who Should Participate?**: Every interactive planning session must include anyone whose work will directly impact on-time delivery.

**Attendee checklist for the interactive planning session**:

* ☑ Project executive
* ☑ Project managers
* ☑ Project planner/scheduler
* ☑ Design manager
* ☑ Construction manager
* ☑ Design discipline leads
* ☑ End user
* ☑ Commissioning agent
* ☑ Other project-specific stakeholders

**Supplies needed**:

* ☑ A large room with sufficient wall and seating space
* ☑ A large, time-scaled chart (plotter paper across a wall, marked off by month and allowing more space at the beginning and less later on)
* ☑ 4”x4” squares of colored paper (color coded by discipline/organization/category) to post on the chart
* ☑ Markers
* ☑ Tape
* ☑ Digital camera to photograph the finished product

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. Set aside sufficient time based on the project size.
   * The minimum time required is typically a half day.
   * Larger projects can require a full day or several days.
2. Prepare the room ahead of time.
   * If the project is large, choose a room with plenty of wall space.
   * Reserve the room according to the anticipated duration.
3. Write activities on post-it notes and position them under the corresponding date.
4. Adjust the post-it notes in accordance with the discussion.
   * Use forward passes and backward passes to determine the start and finish dates.
   * As start and finish dates are posted, reach agreement on what is needed and achievable.
5. Once agreement is reached, photograph the finished product and use it to build the baseline schedule.

**Order for Posting Activities**:

1. Project milestones that establish the parameters for the project schedule:
   * Project start
   * Funding
   * Substantial completion
   * Mechanical completion
   * Commissioning time
   * Occupancy date.
2. Red flag items (use red paper):
   * Fixed dates
   * Critical items
   * Trouble spots.
3. Design releases and deliverables, by package/discipline:
   * Schematic/preliminary design dates
   * Detailed design dates.
4. Key construction dates, such as:
   * Need IFB docs
   * Need IFC docs
   * Begin foundations
   * Begin structural steel
   * Begin elevated slabs
   * Begin OH rough-ins
   * Begin interiors.
5. Identify sequencing of work areas, enabling works, utility tie-ins.
6. Add trigger points and need dates for specific items such as:
   * Floor plans approved
   * P\&IDs issued
   * GMP signed.
7. Need dates for equipment deliveries, anticipated fabrication and delivery time to verify need dates for design and specifications versus availability.
8. Build in subcontracting strategy for key early/critical packages.
9. Add other items as necessary to capture the whole picture.

### The Technique: Critical Path Method (CPM)

### **2.0 Introduction**

The Critical Path Method (CPM) should be used because it is the tried and true method of scheduling, used for decades as a basis of not only project planning but also delay analyses and claims. The CPM is simply a method of scheduling a project where activities are based on network calculations. This method utilizes activity durations and corresponding relationships between the activities to calculate early and late start and finish dates and float based on the differences between the early and late dates.

A CPM includes more than just the graphical plot of the schedule, but also the mathematical analysis, early and late dates and float. One means little without the other. Most complex projects require this type of consideration of scheduling activities over time.

A CPM can:

#### **2.1 The Value of a CPM**

A good CPM schedule is the foundation of a successful construction project. Proper CPM scheduling increases the likelihood of success for contractors and owners and decreases the potential for financial losses associated with delays. It is a management tool that evaluates progress and analyzes the impact day-to-day operations will have on the overall construction project.

Unfortunately, not all CPM schedules bring such value to the project. You must spend the appropriate amount of time and effort in its development in order to ensure you have a tool for your project’s success. Therefore, a CPM schedule is more than just a schedule. A good CPM allows the project manager to build the project on the computer before building it in the field.

A good CPM schedule shows:

* the interrelationship of all activities;
* the logical sequence of construction;
* the emphasis of on-site and off-site activities, and;
* the relationship of each activity to the overall project completion.

Anyone in construction project management will be better equipped to take on the challenges and complexities of managing the construction project if they are prepared. There is no better way of being prepared than to develop a fully-detailed CPM.

**2.2 The CPM Crash Course: Discovering the Critical Path**

The preferred scheduling technique in the construction industry for the past 30 years has been the critical path method (CPM). Preparing a powerful and effective baseline schedule using CPM may be time-consuming, but it is well worth the effort. In fact, the more you know about the logic behind CPM, the more control you will gain over your projects.

Simply put, CPM is a scheduling technique that uses network calculations to arrange activities based on the “critical path.” More technically, CPM is a scheduling methodology that ties activities to a common network, with the starting activity having no predecessor and the finish activity having no successor. While CPM can theoretically be summarized in one sentence, mastering CPM scheduling is much more of an art. The aim of this section is to help you understand the key components that make up CPM scheduling.

**The Critical Path**: The basis of the critical path method is, of course, the critical path. In project management, a critical path is the longest sequence of activities in a project that must be completed on time for the project to finish on time. In other words, if any item on a project’s critical path slips, the project can no longer complete in the allotted timeframe. It is important to identify critical paths on projects, as they must be carefully tracked to keep your project on schedule.

**Float**: While CPM scheduling tracks the schedule by determining the longest path (or critical paths), it also addresses the reality that projects do not always progress as scheduled. This is where float comes in. Float is the amount of time an activity can slip before the project end date is affected. The critical path has the lowest relative float value of all activity chains in a CPM schedule. A project schedule can have either positive or negative float. This is described in more detail later in this section.

**Start and Finish Dates**: Before calculating the float, you must first determine key dates for each activity. CPM assigns an early start (ES), early finish (EF), late start (LS) and late finish (LF) to each activity on the schedule, by using corresponding forward and backward pass calculations (described below). The early dates are then subtracted from your end dates to determine float. The following, simplified case study introduces this concept:

**Simplified One-Activity Case Study**: Let’s say that installing carpet on the third floor of a building will take three days. We know that the earliest date we can start is 02May20. This is the early start date, or ES. Because the activity will take three days, the earliest date we can therefore finish is 04May20. This is the early finish date, or EF. The act of determining the EF based on the ES and the duration of the work is called the forward pass.

Let’s now assume that we also know the carpet must be completed by 07May20 before the critical path is affected. This is the latest date the activity can complete, or the LF. To determine the corresponding LS, we work backwards three work days, and determine that the LS is 05May20. This is the latest date we can begin the work and have it complete on time. The act of determining the LS based on the LF and the duration of the work is called the backward pass.

Now that we have determined the ES, EF, LS and LF, how does this enable us to determine float? Essentially, float is the difference between the latest possible finish date (LF) and the earliest possible finish date (EF), or, conversely, the difference between the LS and the ES. Either way, you will arrive at the same number, a number that reflects how much float, or wiggle room, you have to complete the activity. Using this logic for our carpet installation example, the float for the activity is the difference between the late finish date (LF) of 07May20 and the early finish date (EF) of 04May20. We therefore have three days of (positive) float for this specific activity.

**What is float?**

**QR**: Non-technical definition of float: Wiggle Room

**CPM representation of total float (TF)**: \[ LS - ES = TF \quad \text{or} \quad LF - EF = TF ]

* Remember to account for weekends and holidays when calculating float.

**CPM Calculations**: Our carpet installation example uses common sense to establish the ES, EF, LS and LF dates. The good news, however, is that CPM translates common sense into a mathematical equation, as follows, for ease of calculation on complex projects:

**QR**: Forward and backward pass: \[ ES + RD - 1d = EF \quad LS + RD - 1d = LF \quad EF - RD + 1d = ES \quad LF - RD + 1d = LS ]

**Float calculations are as follows**: \[ LS - ES = TF \quad LF - EF = TF ] Where:

* ES = Early Start
* RD = Remaining Duration
* LF = Late Finish
* LS = Late Start
* EF = Early Finish
* TF = Total Float

**Establishing the Critical Path**: You now have the basic information you need to determine the critical path. Remember, the critical path is “the longest sequence of activities in a project that must be completed on time for the project to finish on time.” This path is also the path with the lowest relative total float (when you consider the float from each activity on the schedule, you arrive at your lowest total float). When a project is on schedule, or ahead of schedule, your critical float value will be zero or some positive number. On the other hand, if you are behind schedule, negative float is generated.

**Float Examples and Summaries**: The tables on the next page illustrate three scenarios for a simplified, three-activity schedule: zero float, positive float and negative float. In all cases two bars are shown, the early bar in green and the late bar in blue. Based on the aforementioned float calculations, you can see how the early and late bars differ depending on whether the schedule is on, ahead or behind schedule. (The shaded areas represent weekends.)

**0 Day Critical Path (Total Float = 0 days)**: In this case, the critical path is 0 days. This means that the early bar and late bar dates are identical. The float calculation will glean an answer of 0 when you subtract the early dates (green/time now bars) from the late dates (blue/drop dead dates).

| Activity ID | Activity Description | Orig Dur | Early Start | Early Finish |
| ----------- | -------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1000        | Activity A           | 10       | 02JUL12     | 13JUL12      |
| 1010        | Activity B           | 20       | 16JUL12     | 10AUG12      |
| 1020        | Activity C           | 10       | 13AUG12     | 24AUG12      |
| 1030        | Completion Milestone | 0        |             | 24AUG12      |

**Positive Float (Total Float = 5 Days)**: In this case the critical path is +5 days. This means that the early bars are five days earlier than the late bars. The float calculation will glean an answer of +5 when you subtract the early dates (green/time now bars) from the late dates (blue/drop dead dates).

| Activity ID | Activity Description | Orig Dur | Early Start | Early Finish |
| ----------- | -------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1040        | Activity A           | 10       | 25JUN12     | 06JUL12      |
| 1050        | Activity B           | 20       | 09JUL12     | 03AUG12      |
| 1060        | Activity C           | 10       | 06AUG12     | 17AUG12      |
| 1070        | Completion Milestone | 0        |             | 17AUG12      |

**Negative Float (Total Float = -5 Days)**: In this case the critical path is -5 days. This means that the early bars are five days later than the late bars. The float calculation will glean an answer of -5 when you subtract the early dates (green/time now bars) from the late dates (blue drop dead dates).

| Activity ID | Activity Description | Orig Dur | Early Start | Early Finish |
| ----------- | -------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1080        | Activity A           | 10       | 09JUL12     | 20JUL12      |
| 1090        | Activity B           | 20       | 23JUL12     | 17AUG12      |
| 1100        | Activity C           | 10       | 20AUG12     | 31AUG12      |
| 1110        | Completion Milestone | 0        |             | 31AUG12      |

**QR**: Quick step-by-step reference to the process presented

1. To determine the amount of float in a project using CPM, the activities’ early and late start and finish dates must be established using your scheduling program’s forward and backward pass algorithms.
2. Once these dates have been established (ES, EF, LS, LF), float can be determined by subtracting your activities’ early dates from the corresponding late dates. This is done for all activities on the schedule.
3. The critical path is then defined by the string of activities with the lowest amount of total float in a project.

**Critical path**: Interrelationship of all activities

**CPM Shows**: Logical sequence of construction, Off/on site activities

**2.3 CPM Step-by-Step**

The graphic below breaks CPM into five “simple” steps. In truth, each step is associated with the definitions and calculations and project-specific twists and turns introduced in section 1.1, but breaking CPM down chronologically is a great way to get a grasp on scheduling your project.

1. **Establish Goals**: If you want to arrive at your destination on time, you need to know where you are going.
   * Process for establishing goals:
     1. Gather all project data needed for schedule development
     2. Read the contract
     3. Identify project-specific goals
     4. Coordinate scheduling goals with management.
   * Project goals may include one or all of the following:
     * Keeping the project on track
     * Illustrating how and when the owner’s overall goals will be met
     * Developing phasing to work on an existing campus or within an owner’s budget constraints
     * Communicating project progress with stakeholders
     * Coordinating construction sequences
     * Identifying early procurement items
     * Establishing critical path activities
     * Insert your project-specific concern here.
2. **Identify Activities**: Break down the goals you have established into manageable work activities to determine which tasks need to be scheduled.
   * Process for developing activity lists:
     1. Study the contract drawings and specifications
     2. Categorize activities according to responsibility, phase and location
     3. Categorize major work by systems, e.g. drywall partitions, mechanical systems, elevators, etc.
     4. Break schedule into major segments including general conditions, material procurement, foundations, structure, exterior, rough-ins, finishes, close-out
     5. Break out activities into workable units, e.g. framing, first floor; framing, second floor
     6. Identify typical “subsets,” then enter this information into a scheduling program
     7. Identify duplicate activities such as typical floors or assemblies
     8. Talk to your subcontractors for activity details— they are truly experts in their fields
     9. Concentrate on critical activities and trades at first. You can add more detail as you continue to study the specifications and drawings and talk to subcontractors, consultants and colleagues. It isn’t possible to cover everything the first go-around, so don’t get overwhelmed.
3. **Estimate Durations**: Now that you have developed your activity list, it is time to determine how long each activity will take.
   * Process for developing activity durations:
     1. Select unit of measure (i.e. days, weeks or months)
     2. Consider seasonal conditions
     3. Identify work restrictions, including local customs, labor agreements, etc.
     4. Perform quantity take-offs as needed
     5. Use productivity analysis: units per time period, number of crews, manpower
     6. Establish production rates, e.g. LF of drywall/day (see Production Rates, section 1.3)
     7. When assigning durations, stay realistic. Overly ambitious activity durations early in the project can mean you spend the rest of the project playing catch-up. Take site logistics, weather impacts and the labor market into account from the start.
4. **Determine Sequences**: With your activities and durations in hand, it is now time to determine the relationships between activities.
   * Process for developing activity logic:
     1. Determine when each activity needs to happen relative to other activities
     2. Take primary contract relationships into consideration
     3. Determine which work must be completed before other activities can begin
     4. Determine what work cannot start until other work is complete
     5. Determine relationship types (as defined in this section)
     6. Use “finish-to-start” relationships whenever possible
     7. Use lags sparingly (a lag is a specified delay between the start or completion of one activity and the start or completion of another activity).
5. **Analyze and Adjust**: Before you finalize and publish the schedule, it is critical that you evaluate the initial schedule and make improvements where possible.
   * Process for analyzing and adjusting:
     1. Strategically compress the schedule if necessary
     2. Strategically expand the schedule if necessary
     3. Confirm the project duration is acceptable
     4. Check to make sure the critical path is logical
     5. Confirm that all pertinent work activities (and trades) are included
     6. Make sure all activities are properly linked
     7. Confirm that the contract requirements are met.

### Section 3

#### Schedule Data: Useful Information

**3.0 Introduction**

The following pages contain scheduling data that has been gathered over several years. The information is primarily based on the east coast mid-Atlantic region. Please note:

* Material and equipment lead times vary based on market conditions.
* Construction production rates vary largely by region although other factors should be considered including union vs non-union, qualified labor availability and market conditions.
* The section on productivity concerns are meant to be used as a general guide only.
* The construction sequencing section is somewhat modifiable by user, subcontractors, etc. but is a useful outline.
* Finally, Scheduling Consideration and Logistics is a helpful listing of factors that may be out of control of the scheduler or project manager but must be considered nonetheless.

**3.1 Lead Times and Production Rates**

Lead times and production rates are critical to construction scheduling. Lead times often drive the critical path, so tracking offsite materials and equipment deliveries is as important as tracking onsite construction. Similarly, production rates—or the rate at which work can be put in place within a specified time period—must be taken into account if you want to build a reliable schedule.

There are many sources for lead times and production rates. These include:

* **QR**: Subcontractor data
* Internal historical data
* RS Means and Walker and other publications.

**Subcontractor Data**: Subcontractors are the best source for lead times and production rates. That said, they have a tendency to safeguard their production rates. As a result, you need to be diplomatic in your requests. The more subcontractors you contact to collect information, which you can then average, the more accurate your information will be.

**Internal Historical Data**: Internal data is also invaluable. Track lead times and production rates on your projects for future use, and reach out to colleagues for additional information. Build this database every time you work with subcontractors.

**RS Means and Walker**: These resources are useful but not always as valuable as other resources. Cross check the information as much as possible.

**QR**: Explanation of Production Rate Charts

Before looking at sample production rate charts, there are a few things you need to understand about the data. Production rate charts are organized according to the following data categories:

* Trade grouping
* Crew sizes
* Daily Output (ONP)
* Units of measurement

**Trade Productivity**: Remember that trades take time to mobilize, and that you can’t assume that crews will “hit the ground running” at their full-throttle production rates.

**Trade Grouping**: In production rate charts, production rates are sorted so that each trade corresponds to the CSI Division nomenclature.

**Crew Sizes**: The logistics of your job will alter the crew size required. Typical crew sizes are called out in the Production Rate Charts, and you need to convert the production rates to match your planned crew size.

**Daily Output (ONP)**: Production rate charts provide rates for three confidence levels: optimistic, normal and pessimistic. If, for example, you have a tight site, you should probably choose the pessimistic value for excavation. Conversely, if a flooring subcontractor has performed extremely well on a previous, similar job, you may want to assign the optimistic value to your calculations.

**Units of Measurement**: Units of measurement vary by trade. For instance, structural steel could be measured by pieces or by tonnage. Other items such as CMU may be calculated by the number of units or by square feet. Again, you need to convert the data as needed using your own conversion calculations.

**3.2 Productivity Concerns**

1. Learning curve: Period of orientation for crews to become familiar with the project conditions. As new workers are added to the project, the effects become less severe when they learn tool locations, work procedures, etc.
   * Minor 10%
   * Average 15%
   * Severe 30%
2. Stacking of trades: As more workers or crews are added to the project, particularly at the end of the project, inefficiencies could occur. Care must be taken when you have the most trades working on the project and you are trying to make up lost time from earlier in the project. Workers may get in each other’s way, have to wait on one another or be otherwise too confined to efficiently do their jobs.
   * Minor 5%
   * Average 10%
   * Severe 15%
3. Concurrent operations: Stacking of contractor’s own force, effect of adding operation to already-planned sequence of operations. Unless gradual and controlled implementation of additional operations made, factor will apply to all remaining and proposed contract hours.
   * Minor 10%
   * Average 20%
   * Severe 30%
4. Crew size inefficiency: Additional men to existing crews “breaks up” original team effort, affects labor rhythm. Applies to base contract hours also.
   * Minor 10%
   * Average 20%
   * Severe 30%
5. Overtime: Lowers work output and efficiency through physical fatigue and poor mental attitude. See Overtime Schedule for inefficiency based upon overtime hours.
   * Minor 25%
   * Average 50%
   * Severe 75%
6. Season and weather change: Change work performed in very hot or very cold weather and contract work delayed forced into either of the weather extremes.
   * Minor 10%
   * Average 20%
   * Severe 30%
7. Fatigue: Unusual physical exertion. If on change order work and workers return to base contract work, effects also affect performance on base contract.
   * Minor 8%
   * Average 12%
   * Severe 16%
8. Beneficial occupancy: Working over, around or in close proximity to owner’s personnel or production equipment. Also badging, noise limitations, dust and special safety requirements and access restrictions because of owner. Using premises by owner to contract completion.
   * Minor 10%
   * Average 20%
   * Severe 25%
9. Joint occupancy: Change causes work to be performed while facility occupied by other trades and not anticipated under original bid.
   * Minor 5%
   * Average 10%
   * Severe 20%
10. Logistics: Owner furnished materials and problems of dealing with owner’s storehouse people, no control over material flow to work areas. Also, contract changes causing problems of procurements and delivery of materials and re-handling of substituted materials at site.

* Minor 10%
* Average 25%
* Severe 50%

**3.3 Tackling Logic: A Guide to Construction Sequencing**

If duration calculations are the science behind scheduling, then logic ties are the art. This section introduces some of the logic ties you will want to consider as you fine-tune your schedule. The examples provided are designed to serve two functions:

1. Introduce various scenarios you are likely to encounter on typical projects
2. Provide food for thought to be used in determining logic ties for your unique projects.

### Section 4

#### Project Roadmap: The Baseline Schedule

**4.0 Introduction**

**Review the Documents**: A thorough understanding of the contract’s scope of work is essential to the development of a project schedule. Often a “Scope of Work” summary is included in Section 1 of the project specifications. Read this first to get a “30,000 foot level” understanding of the project.

Next, read the section on project scheduling requirements, if any. It is imperative that the schedule you prepare is consistent with the contract requirements. Don’t enter into this task lightly by trying to provide the minimum requirements. Instead, do more than what is required because a well thought-out plan in CPM format will help you in the successful management of the project. It takes considerable work up front, but remember, you are developing a project control document that will be updated throughout the life of the project.

Now ask yourself why are you developing the schedule? Are you developing it solely as a management tool? If so, this schedule needs to be an accurate roadmap of how you plan on building the project, so that you can proactively manage your project. But it also needs to be dynamic enough to allow for periodic statusing while being flexible enough to withstand unforeseen site conditions and contract change orders.

Also ask yourself who your intended audience is. Will this be an in-house document only, or will it be submitted to the owner as a contract document? Ask yourself all these questions, but it is always best to assume it will be used as a submitable contract document.

**Building on the Proposal Schedule**: The superintendent should prepare the Baseline Schedule for the project based on the Critical Path Method of scheduling. He should oversee the project team as they plan out the detailed design and construction schedule, incorporating detail from the design team and key subcontractors while maintaining the overall plan. Additionally, the project engineer needs to ensure adequate activities and corresponding durations are reflected for engineering work to ensure timely deliveries of materials and equipment.

The superintendent should be responsible for coordinating the Baseline Schedule with all the other members of the project team. The Baseline Schedule should be issued to the project team, subcontractors and other entities to allow for activity statusing on a monthly basis, or more frequently as required.

**Subcontractors**: If you are fortunate, your subcontractors will contribute to your scheduling efforts. They are the true experts, thus if they submit their activities to you they should be strongly considered. Subcontractors often have agendas different from your own. Consider what you think their agendas are, if any, as you interpret their schedules for inclusion into your own. Be reasonable, and always look for accurate durations and reasonable logic. It would be advisable for you to schedule the work before you get subcontractor input.

An important management tool for the construction management team on any project should be the Baseline Schedule. The senior scheduler or general superintendent should manage this effort and could have another scheduler handling the day-to-day scheduling duties. The primary responsibility of the senior scheduler should be to oversee the development of the project schedule and all subsequent schedule updates.

**4.1 Zooming In: The Baseline Schedule Components**

Now that we have reviewed our scheduling technique (CPM), it is time to focus on our goal: to create a baseline schedule that will become our roadmap to success. In short, the baseline schedule is a detailed, comprehensive CPM schedule that contains all of the scheduling information related to a project. It is the superintendent’s job to oversee and essentially own the baseline schedule. This baseline schedule ultimately becomes the basis of all schedule submittals. It also provides a tool the entire team can use to identify the critical path(s), start and completion dates of major work activities, and key project milestones.

While the baseline schedule links all of the scheduling information on a project, it must also make that information accessible. To act as an effective roadmap for your project, the baseline schedule must provide the level of detail you need, when you need it. The following graphic identifies four key scheduling derivatives that should be accessed (at a minimum)— or “zoomed in on”—in the baseline schedule:

**1. Detailed Activities**: At its core, the baseline schedule is a compilation of the detailed activities that represent all work on a project. A detailed activity schedule, therefore, is the comprehensive baseline schedule itself.

The baseline schedule includes (if applicable):

* Design
* Permitting
* Preconstruction
* Construction
* Sitework
* Owner activities
* Outside agency constraints
* All other work necessary for successful delivery.

Each activity in the baseline schedule must not only be identified, but must also contain the duration and the relationships both within a trade and external to a trade. In addition, the critical path(s) must be identified. In general, the activities within a baseline schedule should be grouped into subcategories and flow from top to bottom and left to right by early start date.

### Section 5

#### Staying on Track: Schedule Updates

**5.0 Introduction**

Construction schedules, no matter how well thought out, are bound to change as a result of the dynamic and often unexpected nature of construction. Consider some of the influences on a project:

* Availability of subcontractors and materials
* Unusually severe weather
* Strikes
* Unforeseen conditions
* Owner changes
* Late approvals
* Design deficiencies
* Labor productivity and coordination.

These challenges are only some of the factors project managers deal with to keep a project on track. We can measure contractor performance and the impact of unanticipated events on a construction project through the schedule updating process.

When we update construction schedules we are usually trying to accomplish one main goal - to find out how the current performance matches our plan for the work. The schedule update needs to reflect the current status of the project to be relevant. Once a schedule update no longer reflects what is occurring in the field it loses its value as a management tool, and it can quickly become outdated and misleading. Because construction projects can change quickly the project schedule should be updated regularly. However, this often does not happen due to the time and effort required to update the project schedule.

An update, properly prepared becomes a “snapshot” of the project at that time. It should reflect when work started, was completed, and the physical status of work in progress. If we need to look back to a particular time in the project, the graphic layout of an updated schedule should quickly illustrate that. It should reflect the as-built conditions of the work in place.

**What does the update tell us?** What is the importance of measuring progress and updating the schedule?

* At any point in the project can you look at the construction progress and determine its exact status?
* If you were the project manager, would you be confident the project is going to finish on time?
* Are you ahead or behind schedule? What is controlling the pace (or status) of the project?
* Is it a particular trade?
* A major contract change?
* Adverse weather?
* Mismanagement?
* Material deliveries?
* Owner constraints?

The schedule on the wall is no good unless it is updated and current. This is how you would know your true project status.

* The update mitigates impacts of unexpected events.
* The update analyzes effects of changes.
* The update identifies changes in critical path.
* Validates schedule detail and logic.

**Bad Habits**:

* Staff hangs the schedule on the wall but nobody uses it.
* Staff is too busy to verify the start and completion of activities and to update the schedule.
* Staff is too busy to incorporate changes into the schedule as they happen.
* The time period between schedule updates is too long, and therefore the update becomes less valuable and too time-consuming.
* Updating input is inaccurate.
* Graphics are too detailed for most people to understand.
* No narrative accompanies it.
* Too many revisions changing the schedule intent.
* Using revisions to force dates or hide lack of progress.

**5.1 Schedule Update vs. Schedule Revisions**

Generally speaking, an update is the process of applying status or actual schedule data to a schedule and a revision is the process of changing the baseline (approved) schedule data to reflect specific dates or status. In other words, these are some of the changes you may make:

* Revise durations
* Revise logic ties
* Revise critical path
* Add/delete activities

Care must be taken here. If your baseline was well thought out, and you got behind schedule, there is no need to revise the schedule to make it appear you are not behind. Also, if your schedule is contractually approved by the owner, you cannot make revisions without prior owner approval. Let your progress in the field determine your remaining schedule dates.

**5.2 Overview: Updating Methodology**

While developing a solid baseline schedule is key, it is equally important to update and maintain the schedule. The process takes time, but if your job is in trouble, you’ll want to know sooner rather than later.

### Section 6

#### Handling Change: Expecting the Unexpected

**6.0 Introduction**

An increase in sophisticated methods of claim preparation have made proper scheduling integral to establishing responsibility and to the recovery of project cost overruns. Scheduling has become not only a tool for guiding performance during the project, but also a method for measuring the accuracy and appropriateness of claims made as a result of performance. Proper use of the project schedule will provide a warning when situations exist that may lead to cost overruns or claims. In the event that a claim situation does occur, the project schedule is an important tool for comparing original plan with actual plan performance to establish what went wrong and who was responsible.

Consider the following:

* The use of the schedule for legal purposes has increased its importance as a legitimate tool in supporting or apportioning delays and damages.
* It provides an effective tool in determining the effect of a change order on the project milestones and completion.

**6.1 Why: Cause and Effect**

Changes are an inevitable part of the construction process. As a scheduler, you need to plan ahead, but you also need to expect the unexpected. A good starting point is understanding potential changes and your project team’s responsibilities related to cost and schedule.

**Cause**: The following items are common causes of changes to the baseline contract. Understanding the likelihood of these events occurring on your specific project is a good way to make educated choices about procurement, communication, subcontracting and more.

* Unforeseen site conditions
* Design defects
* Owner coordination issues
* Inclement weather
* Labor strikes
* Work by others (owner contractors)
* Owner restrictions or areas on hold
* Subcontractor insolvency.

**Effect**: It is equally important to understand how changes can impact your project. To effectively anticipate how a change will affect your schedule, ask the following questions:

* Will the change affect starting times or overall duration of scopes?
* Do you need to account for new long-lead times?
* Which subcontractors does the change directly affect?
* Does the change indirectly affect additional contractors?
* Which activities does the change affect?
* Is the change on or near the critical path?
* If delays are associated with the change, can they be mitigated?

**6.2 What: Non-Excusable, Excusable and Compensable Delays**

When a change occurs, it is important to be proactive. The first step is to determine which of three categories the change falls into: non-excusable, excusable or compensable.

Each of the following definitions illustrates the compensation the contractor is owed based on the type of delay:

* **Non-Excusable Delays**: Non-excusable delays are the sole responsibility of the contractor. Causes of non-excusable delays include inadequate staffing, poor performance and improper construction techniques. Compensation is not owed to the contractor, and the contractor must complete the scope as originally specified without receiving time or money.
* **Excusable Delays**: Excusable delays are beyond the control of and without fault or negligence to the contractor. Causes of excusable delays include severe weather, site access issues and some design changes. Excusable delays extend the overall project duration but do not directly increase or decrease the project value. While the contractor’s baseline schedule is impacted, the total construction cost remains the same.

The following causes are often associated with excusable delays:

* Force majeure (acts of God): Earthquakes, tornadoes, lightning, floods, hurricanes and other occurrences caused by natural forces fall into the force majeure category.
* Severe and unpredictable weather: If severe weather conditions are typical for the region, this is not considered excusable.
* Labor strikes: Strikes are excusable only if they are unforeseen and beyond the contractor’s control. Strikes that are foreseeable at the time the contract is signed are not excusable.
* Material/equipment availability: Delays caused by material and equipment issues can result in excusable time, but only if the problem was unforeseeable and beyond the control of the contractor, subcontractor and suppliers and without fault of the contractors and suppliers.
* **Compensable Delays**: Compensable delays involve changes that impact both the contract price and the schedule and that are beyond the contractor’s control. Compensable delays include unforeseen site conditions, design changes, and requests for changes made directly by the owner or an owner’s representative.

A delay is compensable if it meets all three of the following criteria:

1. Caused by the owner or someone in the owner’s control
2. Results in additional costs to the contractor
3. The contractor has not assumed the risk for the delay.

When a compensable delay occurs, proper and timely notification of changes to the baseline contract is key. Properly documenting impacts is essential to receiving proper compensation.

**6.3 How: Tracking Changes with Fragnets**

So now that you understand the importance of identifying and tracking changes, how do you go about achieving this? It is time to create a fragnet. The term fragnet is short for “fragment of a network.” Fragnets are used to illustrate the effects changes have on isolated activities, groups of activities or the project end date. A fragnet is the clearest way to quantify and communicate the time (and possible costs) owed to a contractor by an owner.

The following step-by-step guide illustrates the basic process for creating a fragnet in P6. The P6 snapshots provided (Snapshot A, B and C) are based on a simplified change order that affects the drywall scope.

1. Save the latest P6 schedule and assign it a unique name.

#### 6.4 Who: Float Ownership

It is a good idea to define float ownership up front, in the contract. If this does not occur, float will usually be exhausted by the first party who needs it – regardless of the reason. The party that owns float gains control over the schedule, which makes assigning float somewhat controversial.

This section briefly describes the ramifications related to float, based on who owns it. Depending on the contract language—or the lack of contract language—the following parties may control float:

* **Owner**: When the owner controls the float, the float can be used at the owner’s discretion. This can be problematic, as the contractor is ultimately responsible for completing the project on time. Implications of owner-owned float include:
* If the owner exhausts the float on an activity that is not on the critical path initially, that activity can soon turn into a critical activity.
* If the owner’s actions generate negative float, the entire project may be delayed.
* The contractor may have to perform additional work without extending the original contract deadline and without extra compensation.
* **Contractor**: When the contractor owns float, the owner becomes liable for the extra time (originally float time) spent on an activity. The owner must compensate the contractor accordingly. Implications of contractor-owned float include:
* Additional work assigned that is not on the critical path could result in an extension to the completion date.
* The float may be considered the property of all contractors and open for use by any contractor on the job.
* **Project**: When the contractor and the owner control the float together, they will compete to exhaust it first. Implications of project-owned float include:
* Extensions of time for performance may be granted to the extent that equitable time adjustments for the affected activities exceed the total float or where otherwise justified.
* The contract completion date is fixed and will be amended only by modifications which include time and are signed by the owner.

**6.5 Concurrent Delays**

A concurrent delay occurs when the owner and the contractor have both caused independent delays to the schedule’s critical path—and therefore the completion date—during the same approximate time period. When this happens, neither party—barring a contract provision to the contrary—can recover damages without a clear allocation of each party’s delay and expense.

1. A concurrent delay occurs when the owner and the contractor have both caused independent delays to the schedule’s critical path.
2. For a delay to be concurrent, the impacts must also be independent.
3. Timing is the third key determinant. Delays do not need to begin and end on the same day in order to be considered concurrent.

***

### 6.6 Schedule Recovery and Acceleration

**Recovery Schedule**: A recovery schedule is required when the project is behind schedule due to changes, delays or the overall progress not being maintained. When this happens, you need to:

1. Determine what steps are required to bring the critical path, completion milestone and project milestones back to the original baseline dates:
   * Overtime (extended shifts)
   * Multiple shifts
   * Additional manpower/equipment
   * Re-sequencing of the work
2. Carefully and accurately record and report the schedule revisions in a chronological format.

**Acceleration**: Acceleration occurs when the contractor increases the rate at which the construction work is performed. Simply put, it means spending additional money over and above what was originally planned for a specific activity—or all activities—associated with the project.

**Types of acceleration**:

1. **Actual acceleration** – Occurs when the contractor receives a specific directive from the owner to complete work prior to the completion date set forth in the contract (or a contract end date modified by both parties). There should be no doubt that this is acceleration.
2. **Constructive acceleration** – This occurs when the owner forces the contractor to complete work ahead of the properly adjusted progress schedule. In other words, your current schedule could reflect approved owner delays that pushed the end date out beyond the contract end date, but the owner could direct you to complete the project on the original contract end date. This version of acceleration is not as clear-cut as actual acceleration.
3. **Voluntary acceleration** – Occurs when the contractor escalates the construction operations in an attempt to mitigate a contractor-caused, non-excusable delay in order to complete the work per contract.

**When to Accelerate a Schedule?**

1. In most cases, accelerating an activity or project should only be done when specifically directed by the owner. When this directive is given, a thorough analysis of the current (updated) schedule of remaining work must be conducted.
2. You should consider all possible ways of shortening the schedule before deciding on the appropriate method. Should you, as the contractor, decide to accelerate, it should be done to compensate for your own non-excusable delays. Still, other ways of expediting the schedule should be explored.

### Glossary

* **Activity**: An operation or process consuming time and possibly resources. An activity is an element of work that must be performed in order to complete a project. An activity consumes time, and may have resources associated with it. Activities must be measurable and controllable. An activity may include one or more tasks.
* **Activity Code**: Any combination of letters, numbers, or blanks which describes and identifies any activity or task shown on the schedule.
* **Activity Duration**: The length of time from start to finish of an activity, estimated or actual, in working or calendar units.
* **Actual Completion Date**: The calendar date on which an activity was completed.
* **Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP)**: The direct costs actually incurred and the direct costs actually recorded and assigned in accomplishing the work performed.
* **Actual Finish Date**: The calendar date on which the activity was actually completed. It must be prior to or equal to the data date. The remaining duration is zero.
* **Actual Start Date**: The calendar date on which work actually began on an activity.
* **As-Built Schedule**: The final project timetable, which depicts for each activity actual start and completion date, actual duration, costs, and consumed resources.
* **Backward Pass**: Calculation of the latest finish time and latest start time for all uncompleted network activities. It is determined by working from the final activity and subtracting durations for uncompleted activities.
* **Baseline**: The reference plans in which schedule performance criteria are documented and against which performance measures are assessed and changes noted.
* **Budget Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS)**: The sum of the budgets for work scheduled to be accomplished (including work-in-process), plus the appropriate portion of the budgets for level of effort and apportioned effort for the relevant time period.
* **Change**: Alteration or variation to a scope of work and/or the schedule for completing the work.
* **Compensable Delay**: Any delay beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the contractor resulting from the owner-caused changes in the work, differing site conditions, suspensions of the work, or termination for convenience by the owner.
* **Completed Activity**: An activity with an actual finish date.
* **Conceptual Schedule**: A conceptual schedule is similar to a proposal schedule except it is usually time-scaled and is developed from the abstract design of the project. This schedule is used primarily to give the owner a general idea of the project scope and an overview of activities.
* **Concurrent Delay**: Two or more delays in the same time frame or which have an independent effect on the end date.
* **Constraint**: An externally imposed factor affecting the schedule of an activity. The external factor may be a resource, such as labor, cost or equipment, or, it can be a physical event that must be completed prior to the activity being restrained.
* **Contract Completion Date**: The date established in the contract for completion of all or specified portions of the work. This date may be expressed as a calendar date or as a number of days after the date for commencement of the contract time is issued.
* **Contract Date**: Any date specified in the contract or imposed on any project activity or event that impacts the activity/project schedule.
* **Critical Activity**: Any activity on a critical path.
* **Critical Path Method (CPM)**: A scheduling technique to determine the length of a project and to identify the activities and constraints on the critical path.
* **Critical Path**: The longest sequence of activities that must be completed on time for the project to finish on time.
* **Cycle**: A repetitive sequence of events or work activities. Cycles can occur within a single trade discipline or across multiple trades.
* **Data Date**: The calendar date that indicates when the project has been updated. The date to which progress is updated and from which future work is scheduled.
* **Detailed Schedule**: A schedule which displays the lowest level of detail necessary to control the project through job completion. The intent of this schedule is to finalize remaining requirements for the total project.
* **Duration**: The time required to accomplish an activity.
* **Duration Percent Complete**: An unreliable updating method that relies on time elapsed rather than work in place.
* **Early Finish**: The earliest time at which an activity can be completed; equal to the early start of the activity plus its remaining duration.
* **Early Start**: The earliest time any activity may begin as logically constrained by the network for a specific work schedule.
* **Earned Value**: The periodic, consistent measurement of work performed in terms of the budget planned for that work. The budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP) is compared to the budgeted cost of work scheduled (BCWS) to obtain schedule performance and it is compared to the actual cost of work performed (ACWP) to obtain cost performance.
* **Event**: An identifiable single point in time on a project. An event occurs only when all work preceding it has been completed. It has zero duration.
* **Excusable Delay**: Any delay beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the contractor or the owner.
* **Finish to Finish Relationship**: This relationship restricts the finish of the work item until some specified duration following the finish of another work item.
* **Finish to Start Relationship**: The standard relationship where the activity of work item may start just as soon as another work item is finished.
* **Finish Variance**: The difference between the expected/budgeted/planned finish date and the actual finish date.
* **Float**: See Free Float, Total Float.
* **Forward Pass**: Network calculations which determine the earliest start/earliest finish time (date) of each activity.
* **Fragnet**: A portion or fragment of a CPM network usually used to illustrate changes to the whole network.
* **Free Float**: The amount of time that the completion of an activity may exceed its scheduled finish time without increasing the start time of any succeeding activity.
* **Hammock**: An aggregate or summary activity spanning the nodes of two or more activities and reported at a summary management level.
* **Imposed Date**: An date externally assigned to an activity that establishes the earliest or latest date in which the activity is allowed to start or finish.
* **Independent Event**: An event which in no way affects the probability of the occurrence of another event.
* **In-Progress Activity**: An activity that has been started but is not completed on the reporting date.
* **Lag**: Specified time increment between the start or completion of an activity and the start or completion of a successor activity.
* **Lag Relationship**: The four basic types of lag relationships between the start and/or finish of a work item and the start and/or finish of another work item are: Finish to Start (F-S), Start to Finish (S-F), Finish to Finish (F-F), and Start to Start (S-S).
* **Late Finish**: The latest time an activity may be completed without delaying the project finish date.
* **Late Start**: The latest time at which an activity can start without lengthening the project.
* **Level of Effort**: Support effort that does not readily lend itself to measurement of discrete accomplishment. It is generally characterized by a uniform rate of activity over a specific period of time.
* **Logic**: Relationship describing the interdependency of starts and finishes between activities or events. Every activity should have a predecessor (except for the initial activity or event), and every activity should have a successor (except for the ending activity).
* **Logic Network Diagram**: Visual representation of relationship between activities.
* **Loop**: A path in a network closed on itself passing through any node or activity more than once, or, a sequence of activities in the network with no start or end.
* **Milestone**: An important or critical event and/or activity that must occur when scheduled in the project cycle in order to achieve the project objective(s).
* **Milestone Report**: An output report at a specified level showing the latest allowable date, expected date, scheduled completion date, and the slack for the successor event contained on each activity or event name flagged as a milestone at the level specified.
* **Milestone Schedule**: A schedule comprised of key events or milestones selected as a result of coordination between the owner’s and the contractor’s project management. These events are generally critical accomplishments planned at time intervals throughout the project and used as a basis to monitor overall project performance. The format may be either network or bar chart and may contain minimal detail at a highly summarized level.
* **Monitoring**: Periodic gathering, validating, and analyzing various data on contract status to determine any existing or potential problems. Usually one accomplishes this through use of the data provided in contractor reports on schedule, labor, cost, and technical status to measure progress against the established baselines for each of these report areas.
* **Near-Critical Activity**: An activity that has low total float.
* **Network**: A logic diagram of a project consisting of the activities and events that must be accomplished to reach the objectives, showing their required sequence of accomplishments and interdependencies.
* **Network Analysis**: Technique used in planning a project consisting of a sequence of activities and their interrelationship within a network of activities making up a project.
* **Network Planning**: A broad generic term for techniques used to plan complex projects using logic diagrams (networks).
* **Non-Excusable Delay**: Any delay caused solely by the contractor.
* **Original Duration**: The initial accepted estimate of an activity duration used in the original baseline schedule.
* **Physical Progress**: The status of a task, activity, or discipline based on pre-established guidelines related to the amount or extent of work completed.
* **Planning**: The determination of a project’s objectives with identification of the activities to be performed, methods and resources to be used for accomplishing the tasks, assignment of responsibility, and establishment of an integrated plan to achieve completion as required.
* **Precedence Diagram Method (PDM)**: A method of constructing a logic network using nodes to represent the activities and connecting them by lines that show logic relationships.
* **Predecessor**: An activity that immediately precedes another activity.
* **Preferential Logic**: The contractor’s approach to sequencing of the work over and above those sequences indicated in or required by the contract documents.
* **Production Rate**: The rate at which work can be put in place within a specified time period.
* **Productivity**: In general terms, labor productivity can be defined as the ratio of the value that labor produces to the value invested in labor. It is an absolute measure of work process efficiency, i.e., a measure of the extent to which labor resources are minimized and wasted effort is eliminated from the work process. In earned value project control practice, productivity is a relative measure of labor efficiency, either good or bad, when compared to an established base or norm as determined from an area of great experience. Alternatively, productivity is defined as the reciprocal of the labor factor.
* **Progress**: Development to a more advanced stage. Progress relates to a progression of development and, therefore, shows relationships between current conditions and past conditions. In networking, progress indicates activities have started or completed, or are in progress.
* **Project**: An endeavor with a specific objective to be met within the prescribed time and dollar limitations and which has been assigned for definition or execution.
* **Project Duration**: The elapsed duration from project start date through project finish date.
* **Projected Finish Date**: The current estimate of the calendar date when an activity will be completed.
* **Projected Start Date**: The current estimate of the calendar date when an activity will begin.
* **Projection**: An extension of a series, or any set of values, beyond the range of the observed data.
* **Project Phases**: The major phases of a project, which include preplanning, design, procurement, construction, start-up, operation, and final disposition.
* **Quantity Percent Complete**: A comparison of the work completed to the current projection of total work. The percent complete of an activity in a program can be determined by inspection of quantities placed as workhours expended and compared with quantities planned or workhours planned.
* **Remaining Duration**: The estimated work units needed to complete an activity as of the data date.
* **Resource**: In planning and scheduling, a resource is any consumable, except time, required to accomplish an activity. From a total cost and asset management perspective, resources may include any real or potential investment in strategic assets including time, monetary, human, and physical. A resource becomes a cost when it is invested or consumed in an activity or project.
* **Resource Histogram**: A graphic display of the amount of resource required as a function of time on a graph. Individual, summary, incremental, resource curve levels can be shown.
* **Revision**: In the context of scheduling, a change in the network logic, activity duration, resources availability, or resources demand which requires network recalculation.
* **Schedule**: The plan for completion of a project based on a logical arrangement of activities, resources available, imposed dates, or funding budgets.
* **Scheduled Completion Date**: A date assigned for completion of activity or accomplishment of an event for purposes of meeting specified schedule requirements.
* **Scheduling**: The assignment of desired start and finish times to each activity in the project within the overall time cycle required for completion according to plan.
* **Scheduling Variance**: The difference between projected start and finish dates and actual or revised start and finish dates.
* **Soft Logic**: A logic sequence whose component activities are less defined and whose interrelationships are conditional.
* **Start to Finish Relationship**: The relationship restricts the finish of the work item until some duration following the start of another work item. Seldom used.
* **Start to Start Relationship**: This relationship restricts the start of the work item until some specified duration following the start of the preceding work item.
* **Substantial Completion**: Work (or a specified part thereof) which has progressed to the point where in the opinion of the engineer, as evidenced by the engineer’s definitive certificate of substantial completion, it is sufficiently complete, in accordance with the contract documents, so that the work (or specified part) can be utilized for the purposes for which it is intended; or if there be no such certificate issued, when final payment is due in accordance with the general conditions. Substantial completion of the work, or specified part thereof, may be achieved either upon completion of pre-operational testing or startup testing, depending upon the requirements of the contract documents.
* **Successor Activity**: Any activity that exists on a common path with the activity in question and occurs after the activity in question.
* **Summary Network**: A summarization of the CPM network for presentation purposes. This network is not completed.
* **Target Date**: The date an activity is desired to be started or completed; either externally imposed on the system by project management or owner, or accepted as the date generated by the initial CPM schedule operation.
* **Task**: Smallest unit of work planned. It must have an identifiable start and finish, and usually produces some recognizable results.
* **Time-Scaled CPM**: A plotted or drawn representation of a CPM network where the length of the activities indicates the duration of the activity as drawn to a calendar scale.
* **Total Float**: The amount of time (in work units) that an activity may be delayed from its early start without delaying the project finish date. Total float is equal to the late finish minus the early finish or the late start minus the early start of an activity.
* **Tracking**: A form of monitoring applied to projects. The measurements are expected to change according to the planned progress.
* **Updating**: The regular review, analysis, evaluation, and reporting of progress of the project; including recomputation of an estimate or schedule.
* **Variance**: The difference between the expected/budgeted/ planned results and the actual results.
* **Work Breakdown Structure**: A product-oriented family tree division of items which organizes, defines, and displays all of the work to be performed in accomplishing the project objectives.
* **Work Unit**: A unit of time used to estimate the duration of activities.
