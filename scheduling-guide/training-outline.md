# Training Outline

## Training Session Overview

This session uses the Hospital America file found in your training folder. Participants are provided with hand-outs that explain relationships, lag, and general CPM guidelines, which coincide with the PowerPoint presentation.

## Pre-Class Preparation

#### Hospital America File Overview

* Contains approximately 30–40 activities organized into a couple of pre-built WBSs.
* Activities include names, trades, and durations (no relationships provided).
* The activities are presented in a non-chronological (random) order for class review.

#### Hand-Outs

* Explain relationships, lag, and general CPM guidelines.
* Align with the slides shown in the PowerPoint presentation.

## Class Activities and Demonstrations

### Step 1: Overview of the Hospital America File

#### A. Display the File:

* Show the list of activities (names, trades, durations) to the class.
* Ensure everyone understands how to navigate the screen.
* Emphasize that the initial order of activities is random.

#### B. Demonstrate Activity Review:

* Explain that these activities are used to build foundational scheduling skills.
* Walk through example activities, highlighting names, trades, and durations.

### Step 2: Adding and Editing Activities

#### A. Adding Additional Activities:

Instruct the class on how to add 5 additional activities.

Demonstrate:

* Inputting associated names.
* Entering durations.
* Selecting trades.

#### B. Discussing Relationships:

* Ask the class which activity should occur first and what should follow.
* Discuss and explain:
  * Different types of relationships.
  * How to input relationships into the schedule.
* Demonstrate by entering a few relationships and hitting the "Schedule" button to show how the first successor is pushed out.

C. Hands-On Practice:

* Allow the class to continue inputting the relationships on their own until complete.
* Go around the room and assist as needed.
* At the end, have everyone hit the "Schedule" button and provide their completion dates.

#### D. Show your work:

* Have the person with the fastest schedule share their screen and discuss their approach.
* Have the person with the slowest schedule share their screen and discuss their approach.

### Step 3: Reviewing and Adjusting Against an Answer Key

#### Answer Key Review:

* Compare everyone’s work with the provided answer key.&#x20;
* Emphasize that while the answer key is not the only right answer, uniformity is needed for the purposes of the class.&#x20;
* Guide the class on how to adjust their schedules to match the answer key.
* Have the class hit the "Schedule" button again to ensure everyone matches.

## Discussion on Milestones and Baseline

### Options to Consider:

#### Milestone Options:

Discuss the option to either input a "current substantial completion milestone" and a "contractual substantial completion milestone" versus using a "must finish by" date.

#### Project OPS and Baseline:

* Introduce the concept of a project OPS.
* Show how to create a baseline.
* Demonstrate filtering for:
  * Critical path.
  * Milestones.
  * Electrical activities (build an Electrical Filter with the group).
  * Near term activities.
* Provide a hand-out titled "update data from project supt, Update 1" for a near-term meeting.

_Note_: This hand-out may be handwritten, scanned, and printed.

## Update Process

### Update 1

50%

#### 1. Scenario Overview:

* This update is provided by the project superintendent.
* The attendee (scheduler) is responsible for using the update to modify the schedule.

#### 2. Update Process:

* Each attendee reviews the update data.
* They then update the schedule and hit the "Update" button.
* Several points to consider:
  * Some items not on the original baseline may change to the critical path.
  * You might intentionally leave a relationship out to observe if the software catches the error.
  * Introduce a casework procurement activity that affects subsequent activities like substantial completion.
  * Possibly leave one activity without an update to see how the class manages incomplete data.
  * Consider including comments about an unforeseen event (e.g., a hurricane) affecting the schedule.

#### 3. Guided Practice:

* Walk through the tougher updates with the class.
* Allow the rest of the attendees to complete their updates on their own.
* Have everyone hit the "Schedule" button and record completion dates.
* Review and discuss a few examples.
* Adjust schedules to match the answer key.
* Check "current vs contract" end dates or negative float indicators to ensure the schedule is aligned.

### Update 2

80%

#### 1. Scenario Overview:

Similar process as Update 1 with added creative twists, such as:

* Added activities.
* New issues or unforeseen events.
* Elements that push the schedule past the end date.
* Soft logic adjustments required to bring the schedule back on track.

#### 2. Final Adjustments:

* Have everyone make the second update.
* Hit the "Schedule" button.
* Emphasize that once all past or in-progress data is gathered, the real work begins by determining if the schedule is good or if changes are needed.
* Finally, check that everyone’s adjusted schedule:
  * Matches the answer key.
  * Shows “current vs contract” end dates or proper negative float to indicate alignment.

#### 3. Filtering with Baseline Milestones:

Re-demonstrate filtering for:

* Critical path (with baseline milestones shown).
* Milestones (with baseline milestones shown).
* &#x20;Electrical activities.
* Near term activities (with baseline milestones shown).

## Conclusion

• Ensure that everyone’s schedule matches at each step.

• Facilitate discussion on options if discrepancies arise.

• Emphasize that uniformity in the schedule is essential for advancing as a class.

• Review updates, answer key comparisons, and logical adjustments throughout the session.
