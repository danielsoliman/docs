# Schedule Data

**3.0 Introduction**

The following pages contain scheduling data that has been gathered over several years. The information is primarily based on the east coast mid-Atlantic region. Please note:

* Material and equipment lead times vary based on market conditions.
* Construction production rates vary largely by region although other factors should be considered including union vs non-union, qualified labor availability and market conditions.
* The section on productivity concerns are meant to be used as a general guide only.
* The construction sequencing section is somewhat modifiable by user, subcontractors, etc. but is a useful outline.
* Finally, Scheduling Consideration and Logistics is a helpful listing of factors that may be out of control of the scheduler or project manager but must be considered nonetheless.
